## Limitation of Liability

QNLLM (Quantum-Neurological Large Language Model) is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The authors and copyright holders make no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or suitability of this software for any particular purpose.

## What QNLLM Is NOT

1. **Not a Production System**: QNLLM is a research prototype intended for academic and research use only. It is not suitable for deployment in production environments without extensive validation and testing specific to your use case.

2. **Not a Large-Scale Language Model**: QNLLM does not compete with or replicate commercial language models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.). It is designed for continual learning research, not large-scale text generation.

3. **Not a Biological System**: QNLLM is a mathematical simulation inspired by biological principles. It does not emulate actual brain function or neurobiology and should not be used for modeling biological systems.

4. **Not a Physical Quantum Computer**: All "quantum-inspired" mechanisms are deterministic mathematical simulations. The system requires no physical quantum hardware and does not provide quantum computing benefits in practice.

5. **Not an AGI System**: QNLLM does not possess consciousness, sentience, or general artificial intelligence. It is a specialized learning system with formal behavioral boundaries.

6. **Not Suitable for Critical Systems**: QNLLM should not be used in life-critical, medical, safety-critical, or high-stakes decision-making applications without extensive independent validation.

## Research Status

QNLLM represents active research in continual learning and formal verification. While the system implements 21 formal behavioral invariants with 17 fully validated:

- Experimental features (Invariants 20-21) carry additional uncertainties
- The system may contain bugs or unexpected behaviors
- Performance characteristics may vary across different hardware configurations
- Edge cases may not be fully covered
- Documentation may be incomplete or contain errors

---

## Accuracy & Completeness

Users are responsible for:
- Understanding the system's capabilities and limitations
- Validating the system's behavior in their specific use case
- Implementing appropriate error handling and monitoring
- Ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations
