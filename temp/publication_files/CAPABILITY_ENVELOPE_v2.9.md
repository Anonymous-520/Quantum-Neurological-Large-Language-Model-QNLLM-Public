# QNLLM v2.9 — Capability Envelope & Scope Declaration

**Version:** 2.9  
**Date:** February 8, 2026  
**Status:** Official Release

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines what QNLLM **is**, what it **is not**, and where it **competes**. This is a legally, scientifically, and academically defensible statement of capability boundaries.

---

## 1. What QNLLM Is

### Core Identity

**QNLLM is a formally verifiable continual learning system** with 21 behavioral invariants:
- **17 validated** (production-ready with empirical evidence)
- **2 specified** (implementation ready, testing in progress)
- **2 experimental** (conservative frameworks with safety boundaries)

### Key Capabilities

✅ **Deterministic Reasoning Engine**
- Reproducible outputs across machines (bit-identical)
- Cryptographically verified snapshots
- Offline CLI (no cloud dependency)

✅ **Bounded, Safe, Traceable**
- Token budgets enforced
- Memory provenance graphs (full DAG)
- Audit trails for all autonomous actions
- No unbounded recursion or parameter growth

✅ **Lifelong Learning Without Regression**
- Formal non-regression guarantees (Invariant 16)
- Order-stable curriculum learning (Invariant 17)
- Multi-timescale memory consolidation

✅ **Cognitive Runtime**
- Adapts to different host systems (with explicit constraints)
- Policy-level adaptation (not algorithm modification)  
- Transparent autonomous actions (full observability)

### Competitive Positioning

**QNLLM competes with:**
- Continual learning research systems
- Adaptive reasoning engines  
- Neuromorphic/cognitive architectures
- Systems claiming "lifelong learning" without formal proofs

**Unique strength:** No public model has 21 formal behavioral invariants that are:
- Mathematically specified
- Empirically validated
- Reproducibly verifiable
- Conservatively bounded

---

## 2. What QNLLM Is Not

### Explicit Non-Claims

**QNLLM does NOT claim to be:**

❌ **Large-Scale Text Generation Model**
- Not competing with GPT-4, Claude, Gemini on raw text quality
- Not a foundation model trained on trillions of tokens
- Not optimized for conversational fluency or creative writing

❌ **Biological System or Brain Simulator**
- No biological neural tissue integration
- No claims of "brain-like" operation beyond mathematical analogy
- No medical or therapeutic applications

❌ **Physical Quantum Computer**
- All "quantum-inspired" mechanisms are **deterministic mathematical simulations**
- No actual quantum hardware required
- No novel physics claims

❌ **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**
- Not claiming human-level general intelligence
- Task-specific learning within bounded domains
- Explicit capability envelope enforcement

❌ **Conscious, Sentient, or Self-Aware System**
- No phenomenological experience
- No qualia or subjective states
- No consciousness claims

❌ **Unbounded Autonomy or Self-Modification**
- All autonomous actions within declared gates
- Safety constraints always active (Invariants 1-21)  
- No removal of safety boundaries

### What QNLLM Does NOT Compete With

**QNLLM does not compete with:**
- Large language models on raw text generation quality
- Production chatbots on conversational ability
- Domain-specific fine-tuned models on narrow benchmarks
- Enterprise GPT-4 deployments
- Consumer AI assistants (Siri, Alexa, etc.)

## 3. Honest Assessment of Current Gaps

### What Is Missing (Acknowledged)

1. ⚠️ **Large Pretrained Text Model**
   - Status: Optional (not required for formal guarantees)
   - Impact: Reduced text generation fluency vs GPT-4
   - Mitigation: Can integrate with external LLMs as memory substrate

2. ⚠️ **Physical Embodiment Demonstration**
   - Status: Simulation-only (Invariant 21)
   - Impact: No robotic or hardware system validation
   - Mitigation: Conservative framework ready for future pilots

3. ⚠️ **Long-Horizon Human Interaction Study**
   - Status: Synthetic task validation only
   - Impact: No multi-month real-world deployment data
   - Mitigation: Formal guarantees hold independent of task domain

4. ⚠️ **Third-Party Independent Replication**
   - Status: Pending publication and community access
   - Impact: No external validation yet
   - Mitigation: Full reproducibility artifacts provided (CLI, snapshots)

**Note:** None of these gaps block publication of the formal system. They represent future work, not current flaws.
