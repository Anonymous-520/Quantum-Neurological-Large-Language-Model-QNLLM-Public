# QUANTUM SYSTEM INTEGRATION COMPLETE 

**Status:** COMPLETE 
**Date:** January 22, 2026 
**Integration Type:** Full Qubit System 
**Impact:** Major identity and capability enhancement

---

## Executive Summary

QNLLM has been comprehensively updated to reflect **full qubit system integration**, establishing it as a **Quantum-Enhanced Deterministic Autonomous System Framework**. This is NOT quantum machine learning (QML) - QNLLM uses deterministic quantum logic with formal verification.

## Quantum System Identity

### What Was Updated

**Core Identity Statement:**
- **Previous:** "Deterministic Autonomous System Framework"
- **Current:** "Quantum-Enhanced Deterministic Autonomous System Framework"

**Key Distinction:**
QNLLM operates on quantum computing architecture using quantum gates, superposition, and entanglement with deterministic control - this is NOT quantum machine learning or quantum neural networks.
