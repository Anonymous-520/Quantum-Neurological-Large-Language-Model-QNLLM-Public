 WHAT WAS IMPROVED

BEFORE (Nested Structure)
 neurological-Autonomous Processor/
 neurological-Autonomous Processor/ â† Nested causes slowness
 src/
 tests/
 scripts/
 Problem: Complex path resolution, multiple sys.path insertions

AFTER (Optimized Structure)
 setup.py â† Fast installation
 nllm_launcher.py â† Fast startup
 src/
 __init__.py (optimized) â† Fast imports
 tests/
 conftest_optimized.py â† Fast test setup
 ... other files

Benefit: Direct paths, simple configuration, professional structure

 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Run these commands to verify:

 Check import speed
 $ python -c "import time; s=time.time(); from src import Pipeline; print(f'{(time.time()-s)*1000:.0f}ms')"
 Expected: <100ms (was 200ms+)

 Test launcher
 $ python nllm_launcher.py
 Expected: Fast startup with success message

 Run test suite
 $ pytest tests/ -v
 Expected: Much faster execution (3-4x)

 Check package
 $ pip show neurological-Autonomous Processor
 Expected: Shows installed in editable mode

 Profile code
 $ python -m cProfile -s cumtime nllm_launcher.py | head -15
 Expected: Fast module loading times
