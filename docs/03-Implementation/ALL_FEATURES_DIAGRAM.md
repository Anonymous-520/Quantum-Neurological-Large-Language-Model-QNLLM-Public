 QUANTUM NEUROLOGICAL LARGE Autonomous Processor QNLLM - ALL FEATURES ACTIVE 

 USER INTERACTION LAYER 

 5. EMOTION AWARENESS 
 Detects user emotion 
 Adjusts response style 

 3. REAL-TIME ADAPTATION 
 Tracks user signals 
 Adjusts parameters 
 Learns preferences 

 CORE PIPELINE 

 STAGE 1: Context Assembly 
 - Retrieve relevant memories 
 - Apply emotion-based adjustments 
 - Integrate user preferences 

 STAGE 2: processing & Generation 
 - Generate response with adjusted temperature 
 - Apply safety checks 
 - Quality scoring 

 STAGE 3: Response Delivery 
 - Format output 
 - Log metrics 
 - Update session state 

 4. AUTONOMOUS OUTPUT MEMORY STORE 1. SELF-REWRITING 
 (Shared State) 

 Monitors cognitive Memories Analyzes codebase 
 state Decay rates Proposes improvements 
 Detects triggers Activations Safe boundaries 
 Generates insights Metadata Dry-run mode 
 Reflections 
 State reports Thread-safe No auto-modifications 

 2. CONTINUOUS BACKGROUND LEARNING (MTL) 

 Sample â†’ Query â†’ Compute 
 Prompts Teachers Agreement 

 Generate Quality 
 Signal 

 Update Memory 
 Plasticity 

 Runs independently (separate thread) 
 Non-blocking (never delays user responses) 
 Safe (only modifies decay rates) 
 Continuous (300s intervals)
